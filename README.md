# CPPStaticStudentRosterTable
This program reads input strings, and parses each index of the string array and determines validity of emails, average roster hours, and adds or removes students from a roster object.

Compile the program with "g++ *.cpp" after downloading the file. You must have the standard C++ libraries in your environmental variables on your computer. Here is the expected printed output from running in Powershell!
